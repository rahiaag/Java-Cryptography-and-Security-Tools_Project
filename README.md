**Operations:**

Users can choose from the following operations:

**1) Modified Caesar Cipher (Option 1)**

**2) Huffman Text File Compression (Option 2)**

**3) Password Strength Checker (Option 3)**

**4) Exit (Option 4)**

**Modified Caesar Cipher:**

Encrypts and decrypts messages using a modified Caesar cipher with a custom alphabet and shift.

**Huffman Text File Compression:**

Compresses a text file using Huffman coding. Users need to have an "input.txt" file for compression.
